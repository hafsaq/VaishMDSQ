# VaishMDSQ
Multiple Description Scalar Quantizer (MDSQ) based on V.A. Vaishampayan's 1993 paper

This is a Matlab simulation of Vaishampayan's MDSQ I created in 2009. I'll be modifying these files over the course of next week by adding more comments and will also be adding a document describing the usage. I've used this MDSQ as a building block of a source-optimized vector mutiple description coding system.
